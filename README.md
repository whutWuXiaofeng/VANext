# VANext
Predciting Human Mobility via Variational Attention

# Environment 

Python 2.7 & Tensorflow

# Details

1. Source code: NYC_gated.py (the demo code is implemented for NYC dataset in our paper)

2. AMSGrad.py: optimizer, you can choose Adam or AMSGrad.py

3. attention.py. It is an old version, if you want to use.

Btw, as to the poi embedding, you can use the causal embedding method described in our paper.
